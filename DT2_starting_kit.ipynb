    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Diabetes is a growing disease, affecting over 10% of the worldwide population. The vast majority of diabetics are type 2 diabetics (96%), that is generally characterized by a resistance to insulin, which is a molecule that enables glucose to enter the cells and provide energy. Not being able to properly consume sugar results in several complications that are all tied up to the high sugar level concentration in the blood due to not being able to consume it, resulting in possible blindness, hearth disease, infections, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is one today's most important challenge to properly diagnose diabetics, as short as possible to prevent complications to settle. At the moment, diabetes is diagnosed in multiple ways, one of the most secure and proper one being HbA1c measurement from blood samples. The measurement of HbA1c for a sain individual is around 5.7%, while it is said to be diabetic-like when it reaches 6.5% and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this technique has proved to be really efficient in the diagnosis, it has two main downsides that we would like to tackle in this study:\n",
    "- First, HbA1c is a post-disease settlement indicator, as it requires the patient to have abnormally high sugar levels over 3 months to be indicating the disease. One would rather like to be able to diagnose diabetes before it reaches that critical point.\n",
    "- Second, HbA1c being a blood measurement, which is naturally invasive for the patient and some may even be really reluctant and refuse to go for a diagnosis. Also, it requires careful analysis in a medical lab, which obviously costs money.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the goal of our study is to provide a machine learning algorithm that is able to predict whether or not somebody may become diabetic in the coming time, based on blood glucose measurements from a non-invasive Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM), as well as gathered clinical data for the patient over the duration of the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "(explain what are the features -not too much detail, we got deeper after-, what's the CGM thingy, what's iPro, framework of the study, link to the paper, etc...)\n",

    "The KNNImputer class provides imputation for filling in missing values using the k-Nearest Neighbors approach. By default, an euclidean distance metric that supports missing values, nan_euclidean_distances, is used to find the nearest neighbors. Each missing feature is imputed using values from n_neighbors nearest neighbors that have a value for the feature. The feature of the neighbors are averaged uniformly or weighted by distance to each neighbor.\n",
